Hey y'all!

My name's Pierce Gloyer. I'm not a computer scientist or programmer by trade... but that doesn't mean I'm not a computer scientist just for fun!
I'm currently in school for Electrical Engineering, and after a class introduced me to Python and Git, I started messing around with it just for fun.

Right now, my only major project on here is my own knock-off version of PacMan.
(Bandai-NAMCO, I created this for educational purposes to teach myself code and to show off my skills. Don't fight me. Mine will never live up to the magnificence that is PacManÂ©).

Feel free to download any files/folders I have on here.
